# More On Folders
As discussed a `BabelVR` folder in `My Documents` will be created. In this folder are various subfolders. The following folders are relevant to end-users:
## Nii
Place all your Niftii (Nii) images here and they will be accessible from the Volumes menu.
## Objects
Place any Mesh (OBJ format) objects in this folder and they will be accessible from the Volumes menu.
## Exports
Any data that is saved via the Export function is put here. For example, morphoJ files. 
## Screenshots
The snapshot tool creates timestamped PNG images when activated and these are stored in here.

It is advised *NOT* to tamper with the other folders in the `BabelVR` directory as they are used internally by the software.
